# ðŸ§  RAG-Based Chat Backend with Flask, LangChain, Gemini & FAISS

This backend project provides a lightweight Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) API that supports chat with memory and a dynamic knowledge base powered by document uploads. It uses:

- [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/) as the web framework
- [LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/) for orchestration and session memory
- [Gemini](https://ai.google.dev/) for embeddings and response generation
- [FAISS](https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss) for storing and retrieving document vectors
